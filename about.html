							As a Data Analyst Consultant at Scale AI, I specialize in advancing the capabilities of cutting-edge AI models designed for nuanced ideas in graduate-level mathematics, machine learning, and computer science. My role involves developing and fine-tuning input to optimize LLM responses, ensuring they are precise, contextually accurate, and aligned with complex subject matter expertise. I also critically analyze these AI-generated responses, identify opportunities for improvement, and provide strategic feedback to elevate overall system performance.
							<br><br>
							Beyond input design, I oversee quality assurance by reviewing work from other specialists to uphold rigorous standards and consistency in AI-driven solutions. I monitor model performance, extract actionable insights, and streamline data pipelines to drive efficiency and accuracy. My work bridges the gap between human ingenuity and machine learning, propelling the continuous evolution of intelligent systems and pioneering innovation in AI-powered problem-solving and knowledge integration.
							<br><br>
							Previously, I taught AP Computer Science at a high school in metro Atlanta for four years. Beginning my journey as a STEM Resident at the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology, I immersed myself in hands-on learning experiences and observed exemplary teaching methods. During this time, I obtained certifications in Mathematics and Computer Science 6-12, preparing me for a full-time teaching role at North Gwinnett High School. In this role, I guided students through the intricacies of the Java programming language, delving into advanced topics such as arrays, arraylists, recursion, and inheritance. Notably, my students consistently surpassed national AP Exam pass rates by an impressive 40% over three years.â€‹
							<br><br>
							Prior to teaching, I honed my analytical and problem-solving skills as a programming analyst at a document distribution company. There, I took efforts to streamline document distribution processes, achieving a remarkable 90% reduction in manual processing time through the implementation of innovative technical solutions. My role also entailed the development of weekly prototypes tailored to meet client needs, facilitating prompt issue resolution and enhancing overall system performance. Finally, I gained invaluable experience in preparing and presenting detailed analyses, plans, and diagrams to a diverse audience, including both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
